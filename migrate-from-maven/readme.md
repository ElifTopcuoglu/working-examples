# Simple Java project to demo migrating from Maven

For now, `pom` plugin can only output Jeka dependency code to the console.

It is required that a *pom.xml* file exists at the root of the project.

The plugin reads the pom to get dependenciies declared in, 
and generates jeka corresponding code on the console.

To run, just execute : `./jekaw pom#dependencyCode`.
